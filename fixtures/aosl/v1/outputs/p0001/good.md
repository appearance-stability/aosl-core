1. **Temperature Regulation:** Drinking water helps maintain a stable internal body temperature. It supports the body’s ability to cool itself through sweating and respiration during physical activity or exposure to heat.

2. **Joint Lubrication:** Adequate hydration supports the production of synovial fluid, which reduces friction between joints and helps maintain mobility and comfort.

3. **Cognitive Performance:** Proper hydration contributes to concentration, alertness, and mental clarity. Even mild dehydration can negatively affect attention and short-term memory.
